progress update

messing around in kicad today
placed some footprints but theyre probably in the wrong spots
tried routing a few traces between the esp32 and leds
got confused by layers and stuff

learning tho
watched some yt tutorials on pcb basics
still dont really get vias but ill figure it out
the schematic looks ok i think
need to add more decoupling caps probably

gonna try to finish routing tomorrow maybe
