hardware progress

opened kicad for the first time this week
its kinda overwhelming but getting the hang of it

what ive done so far:
- made a new project
- added esp32 devkit footprint to schematic
- placed some led connector symbols
- added power input stuff

messing with pcb layout:
- placed footprints on the board
- tried to arrange things logically
- no routing done yet, just placement

learning stuff:
- watched a few youtube tutorials on kicad basics
- still confused about design rules
- not sure what trace widths to use
- ground planes seem important but idk how to do them right

gonna keep experimenting before i actually route anything
