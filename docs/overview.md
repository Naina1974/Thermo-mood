thermo mood cube

basically its an led cube thing that changes colors based on the room temp and stuff
using an esp32 and some sensors to read temp/humidity
the leds react to the environment so its like a mood lamp but smarter

why am i building this?
idk i thought itd be cool to have something on my desk that actually does something
plus i wanna learn pcb design and embedded stuff
seemed like a fun project to start with
