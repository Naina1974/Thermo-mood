moodcanvas overview

so the idea is an led display thing that reacts to the room
like temp, humidity, maybe light levels
using an esp32 and some sensors

the vibe should be calm and aesthetic, not like a gaming rgb thing
more like a soft glow that changes slowly based on environment
something you could put on a desk or shelf

thinking wood frame with a diffuser on top
maybe frosted acrylic or something
still figuring out the exact shape and size

honestly im still learning a lot of this stuff
pcb design is new to me and so is embedded coding
but thats kinda the point, wanna learn by building something cool
