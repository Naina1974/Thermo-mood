# build notes

dec 3-6:
mostly planning + learning rn.
installed kicad and trying to understand routing + spacing.
firmware is just a draft with fake sensor values because i don’t have hardware.

notes:
- leds need a lot of power so i need to figure that out before ordering anything.
- diffuser material matters a lot, otherwise it just looks harsh.
- epoxy might be expensive so i might do a small test first.

overall just trying to plan everything before spending money.
