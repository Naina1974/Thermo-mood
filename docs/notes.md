random notes and questions

- how many leds can esp32 handle before timing gets weird?
- whats the difference between ws2812b and sk6812?
- do i need level shifting for 3.3v to 5v data line?
- should i use a mosfet for led power control?

things to research:
- pcb trace width for power lines
- decoupling capacitor placement
- how to calculate power supply size
- diffuser materials and where to buy

challenges im expecting:
- soldering small components
- getting clean pcb layout
- making animations smooth
- fitting everything in a nice enclosure

might be overthinking some of this but better to plan ahead i guess
