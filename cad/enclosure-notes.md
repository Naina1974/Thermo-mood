enclosure ideas

thinking wood frame with epoxy top
would look cool with the leds glowing through
maybe walnut or oak for the base

diffuser problems:
- need something to spread the led light evenly
- tried paper but it looks cheap
- acrylic might work but idk how to cut it
- frosted plastic from amazon maybe?

mounting:
- not sure how to hold the pcb inside
- standoffs? hot glue? lol
- need access to usb port somehow
- ventilation for heat maybe
