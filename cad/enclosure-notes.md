enclosure notes

basic idea:
- simple wood frame, maybe walnut or oak
- diffuser on top to spread led light evenly
- clean minimal look, no visible screws if possible

aesthetic goals:
- should look like furniture not electronics
- warm natural materials
- soft glowing light, not harsh spots

diffuser options:
- frosted acrylic sheet
- milk white plastic
- maybe paper/fabric for softer look
- need to test what spreads light best

mounting challenges:
- how to hold pcb inside securely
- need access to usb for programming
- might need ventilation holes for heat
- cable management for power input

still figuring out exact dimensions
depends on led count and pcb size
