enclosure design ideas

option 1: flat panel
- thin frame with leds underneath diffuser
- simple to build, looks like a light panel
- cons: boring maybe, limited depth for components

option 2: box/cube shape
- more room for pcb and wiring inside
- could have leds on multiple sides
- cons: harder to build, heavier

option 3: weird organic shape
- something unique and sculptural
- would need 3d printing or complex woodwork
- cons: way harder, maybe later

diffuser is required for all options
without it youd just see individual led dots
need to find good material thats not too expensive

leaning toward flat panel for first version
keep it simple, can always make v2 fancier
